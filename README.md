# **US Congress Tweets NLP Analysis: Unveiling Political Sentiments**

## **✨ Introduction**
Welcome to **US Congress Tweets NLP Analysis**, where the intricate world of political discourse meets the precision of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our project is an adventurous foray into the Twitter activities of US politicians, employing NLP to decode and analyze their digital communications. We aim to illuminate the patterns and sentiments embedded in political tweets, offering insights into the consistency of political stances and the diverse issues that shape our political landscape. At the core of our endeavor lies the meticulous gathering and analysis of tweets using advanced NLP tools like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition (NER), transforming raw data into a comprehensive understanding of political discourse.
